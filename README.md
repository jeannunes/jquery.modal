# jquery.modal
JQuery Modal is a JQuery Plugin wich allows you to transform your html elements into modal windows.

## Instalation
JQuery Modal requires JQuery to work properly. To install JQuery Modal into your page, simply load the .js script file tag inside the tag body of your html.
```
<body>
...
<script src='jquery.modal.latest.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
</body>
```


## Usage

JQuery Modal doesn't require any previous configurations. You can use it as it is by default. Simply call `$(element).modal();`, where **element** is the element you want to turn into a modal window.
