# JQuery Modal

JQuery Modal is a JQuery Plugin wich allows you to transform your html elements into modal windows.

## Instalation

JQuery Modal requires JQuery to work properly. If you want it working 120%, you have to add some elements to your code.
First load the file `jquery.modal.css`
```
<head>
	...
	<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='jquery.modal.css'/>
</head>
```
```
<body>
	...
	<script src='jquery.modal.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
</body>
```

## Usage

JQuery Modal doesn't require any previous configurations. You can use it as it is by default. Simply call `$(element).modal();`, where **element** is the element you want to turn into a modal window.
